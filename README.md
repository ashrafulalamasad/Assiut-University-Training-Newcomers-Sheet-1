# 🚀 Assiut University Training Newcomers Sheet #1 (Data Types & Conditions) – C++ Solutions 💻

<br>

## Overview 🔍  
***Welcome to the first sheet of the Assiut University “Newcomers” training series!***  
This repo contains **comprehensive C++ solutions** for mastering two foundational topics: **Data Types** and **Conditional Statements**. Each example is **fully explained**, helping you build a solid understanding of how to declare and use variables (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`), manage user input, and write decision logic (`if`, `if-else`, `else if`, `switch`) step by step. 💡

## Features ✨  
This repository is part of a complete C++ learning series for the Assiut University Training – Newcomers program. Each sheet targets a specific topic in C++, and the structure remains consistent across all repositories to support smooth and focused learning.

- 📚 **Topic-Focused Solutions**  
  Each repository covers one key C++ concept (such as Data Types, Conditions, Loops, Arrays, etc.) with dedicated problems and detailed solutions.

- 💬 **Beginner-Friendly Solutions**  
  Every `.cpp` file includes clean code, logic, syntax, and programming practices in a way that’s easy to follow.

- 🔢 **Organized File Naming**  
  Solutions are numbered and named clearly for a logical learning flow and quick reference.

- 🧠 **No-Boilerplate, Pure Logic**  
  Each file focuses strictly on the core logic relevant to the problem — no unnecessary code or extra folders, just straight-to-the-point solutions.

- 🔁 **Reusable Format Across Sheets**  
  This same layout is used across all sheets in the training (e.g., Sheet #1, Sheet #2, etc.), making it easy to navigate, compare, and continue learning efficiently.

 ### 🚀 Perfect for students, C++ beginners, and anyone looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills step by step!
